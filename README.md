# Huffman
An application of binary trees and priority queues in an implementation of the Huffman compression algorithm submitted as part of Stanford's Programming Abstractions class

All implementation occurs in the encoding.cpp file, which includes the building of an encoding tree and map to facilitate the encoding of inputted strings or the reverse, decoding existing encodings.

The full spec can be found in the repository as 'Assignment_05_Huffman.pdf'.
